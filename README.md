# GFX-Screen-Creator

## Brief description
Simple JavaScript app, that lets you create your custom screens for Arduino displays. I decide to create it because I nowhere have seen any app of this type. I think it's really useful especially when designing simple Arduino designs

#### Instalation

To run application just download the repo, unzip it, and double-click "main.html" file.
After that you are ready to create!

## Usage

#### Initialisation

Firstly, at the top-left corner, you have to chose your displays resolution (for example 128x64 on standard OLED screen)
After typing in the resolution hit "Enter" on your keyboard - this will initiate the screen screator

#### Toolbar

On the top toolbar you have diferent tools, which correspond to diferent shapes provided by original Adafruit GFX library
(More tools coming soon ;))

To UNDO changes use well-known "Ctrl + Z"

#### Typing

You can edit text as in usual text editor, app supports standard Adafruit GFX library font
When typing, above the toolbar, you have the abilit to set font's size, e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc

## Build!

When you're done with your creation just hit "BUILD" and copy the results to your Arduino code :)
